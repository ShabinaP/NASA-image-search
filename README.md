# React Technical Test - NASA Image Search

This project was created in response to a mock 'technical task' brief.
The aim of this project was to display specific sets of images in response to a search query inputted by the user, using the NASA images API.

Axios, PropTypes

### `npm start`

This command will run the app in development mode.  Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder

### If I had more time I would:
- Add animation to the images so it is visually appealing (e.g: on hovering over the images, a short description would appear)
- Add a filter function to sort images (e.g: date photo was taken, oldest to newest)
- Deploy the app via Heroku/Github Pages
